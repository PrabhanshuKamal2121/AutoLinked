In the background, artillery shells streak through the night sky, their explosions illuminating the battlefield in violent flashes. The ground trembles with each impact, shaking loose debris from above. A comrade beside me fumbles for his cigarette, his fingers trembling as he lights a match. A whistle pierces the chaos‚Äîthe signal to charge.
